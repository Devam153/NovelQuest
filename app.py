        ## Our Mission
        
        NovelQuest was created to solve a common problem faced by book lovers: finding the perfect book that truly matches their interests and preferences.
        
        Many book readers face the challenge of finding the perfect book that aligns with their specific interests and preferences. Existing filters (like genres, authors, date) are helpful, but they often leave readers wanting more context about the book's content and themes.
        
        NovelQuest aims to create a more personalized and nuanced book recommendation experience, helping users discover books they will truly enjoy based on their specific interests.
        
        ## How We're Different
        
        - **Beyond Simple Categories**: We understand that your reading preferences are more complex than just "mystery" or "romance" - you might want a mystery with strong female characters, atmospheric settings, and no violence.
        
        - **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Our platform leverages advanced AI to understand the nuances of your preferences and match them with books that truly fit what you're looking for.
        
        - **Conversation-Based**: Unlike traditional search engines, NovelQuest allows you to have a conversation, refining your preferences as you go.
